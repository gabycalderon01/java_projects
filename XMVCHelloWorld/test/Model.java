/**
 * In MVC, the Model class contains the data for the application as well as 
 * any data logic.  In this example, the only datum is the name and there is 
 * no data logic.
 * <p>
 * The Model knows nothing about the View or the Controller, i.e., the Model 
 * contains no references to objects of either class.  The Model is fully
 * compatible with any sort of user interface, e.g., console, GUI, Web, etc.
