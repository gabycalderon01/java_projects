/**
 * This program illustrates the use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design 
 * pattern in a very simple console-based program. Many MVC tutorials assume a
 * GUI view, making the sample programs more difficult to understand.
 * <p>
 * MVCHelloMain contains the main() method and executes the program by
 * instantiating an anonymous Controller object.  In an alternative design,
 * the main() method could declare Model and View objects and then pass those
 * objects to the Controller.
 * <p>
 * Javadoc comments for methods and constructors are omitted throughout.
